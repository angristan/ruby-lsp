### `unless`

[Read this documentation in the browser](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/blob/main/static_docs/unless.md)

The `unless` keyword is used to execute a block of code only if a specific condition is false. It is the opposite of the `if` keyword, providing a more readable way to handle negative conditions.

```ruby
temperature = 10
unless temperature >= 20
  puts "It's cold outside."
else
  puts "It's warm outside."
end
```
