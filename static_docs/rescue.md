[Read this documentation in the browser](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/blob/main/static_docs/rescue.md)

The `rescue` keyword is used to define an exception handling block. It is typically used with `begin` and `end` to handle exceptions raised in the `begin` block.

```ruby
begin
  # Code that might raise an exception
rescue ExceptionType => e
  # Code that runs if an exception occurs
end
```
