[Read this documentation in the browser](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp/blob/main/static_docs/ensure.md)

The `ensure` keyword is used to define a block of code that will always execute at the end of a `begin` block, regardless of whether an exception was raised.

```ruby
begin
  # Code that might raise an exception
ensure
  # This code will always run
end
```
